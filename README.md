# SynoMatch — Quiz des synonymes FR

SynoMatch is a bite-sized quiz app to practice French synonyms. Answer “Synonym or not?” in seconds, get clear feedback, and build vocabulary through quick, focused rounds.

- Goal: Encourage rapid recognition of synonym relationships and strengthen vocabulary with short, repeatable sessions.
- Style: Simple, playful, and minimal—ideal for daily practice.

## How It Works
1) Start a quiz (e.g., 10–20 pairs).
2) For each pair, decide “Synonym or not?” (True/False).
3) Receive immediate feedback and move to the next pair.
4) See your final score and replay to improve.
